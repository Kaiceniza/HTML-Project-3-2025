    <p style ="font-size: x-large;">
       I go to the Borough of Manhattan Community College located at 199 Chambers Street. 
       It is a two-year college with a variety of majors, mine being Computer Science. 
       I am currently taking CSC331, CSC350, and CIS385. I have one semester left and would like 
       to retake some courses to improve my GPA
